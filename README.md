### **Summary**

-	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The advantage of refactoring code is making it more efficient. By taking less step to do the same functions, time is saved. However, depending on the purpose of the code or the point of entry on a subsequent data analyst, time to run a macro might be increased. This can be a result of expanding the code or 
a number of other issues.

-	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

In my particular example, the time increased. However, I am relying on a wireless connection where the download speeds are not guaranteed.
